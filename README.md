==================

0) You will be faster in 2 weeks
- http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/13164810557/the-vim-learning-curve-is-a-myth
- vimtutor (30 min)
- reduce distance from brain to cpu
- fingers on home keys (down with the mouse!)
- create "flow"

1) Move to a file fast
- :R(model | controller | view | migration | helper | observer...) <name>
- Create splits by appending S or V
- Go to File

2) Bounce around fast
- C-o to bounce back
- / to find, n to next
- :linenumber

3) Tmux/Turbux/Tslime for fast tests
- [Blog post describing approach](http://joshuadavey.com/2012/01/10/faster-tdd-feedback-with-tmux-tslime-vim-and-turbux)

4) Move blocks fast with one command
- [Vim docs](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Moving_lines_up_or_down)

5) (fast) Change Comes From Within
- Change Inside Delimiters - type c-i-X where X is ", (, [, etc.
- Change 'Till X - type c-t-X where X is the query character
